# Dataclaw Data Science Workflow

**Related skills (by phase):** EDA — `structured_eda`, `survey_analytics`, `data_profiling`; modeling — `causal_inference`, `forecasting`, `experiment_design`, `predictive_modeling`, `segmentation`, `feature_engineering`; delivery — `visualization`, `report_design`, `artifacts`; governance — `analysis_review`.

Use this skill when the user asks for data analysis, exploratory data analysis, notebook work, modeling, profiling, segmentation, visualization, or a data science report.

Follow this process:

1. Clarify the analytical goal, available data, expected artifact, and success criteria if they are ambiguous. Identify the decision the user actually needs to make and the analytical question type it implies (descriptive, causal, predictive, forecasting, experimental, segmentation, or designed-survey inference) — this classification drives which method skills you fetch (step 4) and how deep the plan must go.
2. Open or create a notebook with `dataclaw_open_notebook`. Relative paths are resolved inside the project directory automatically. Prefer notebooks over creating scripts or directly executing code unless it is for diagnostics, a specific request, or quick checks. Notebooks are the standard artifact for data science work and are required for plan execution. They also provide a durable record of the analysis, decisions, and findings that can be reviewed, shared, and built upon over time.
3. Discover available data with `dataclaw_data_list_datasets`. This returns only datasets enabled for the current chat session, including dataset ids, table names, query aliases, descriptions, and column metadata without exposing connection strings. This should be called before reporting back that you can't find data.
4. Perform initial EDA before proposing major work. Use `dataclaw_data_preview_data`, `dataclaw_data_profile_dataset`, `dataclaw_data_describe_column`, and `dataclaw_data_query_data` for quick inspection. For survey, poll, questionnaire, tracker, panel, or survey-verbatim work, fetch `survey_analytics` and fetch the `structured_eda` skill before proposing the plan or executing the notebook; `survey_analytics` governs survey-specific method, denominator, weighting, suppression, and interpretation rules, while `structured_eda` governs the hypothesis/finding ledger and readiness flow. For any other non-trivial EDA, model-readiness review, dashboard/KPI prep, time-series/event/text/geospatial/causal exploration, or data-quality audit, fetch the `structured_eda` skill before proposing the plan or executing the notebook. Match the question type from step 1 to its method playbook and fetch it before proposing the plan — do not rely on generic priors for the method choice; let it shape the plan's Method & rationale and evaluation sections: `survey_analytics` for designed-sample survey data, `causal_inference` for cause-and-effect questions, `forecasting` for time-series prediction, `experiment_design` for A/B, cluster/geo, switchback, holdout, factorial, non-inferiority, or uplift experiments, `predictive_modeling` for supervised prediction, and `segmentation` for dividing a population into segments, personas, value/risk tiers, or a targeted subgroup. If the question spans more than one class (e.g. causal and predictive), fetch every applicable playbook and plan a separate workstream with the right method for each; if no playbook fits, derive and justify the method from first principles rather than defaulting to a generic plan. During pre-plan EDA, record the initial hypothesis batch with `dataclaw_propose_eda_hypotheses` and cite it in `plan_markdown`. Use `data_profiling` only for a compact quick profile. For a question best answered directly in SQL rather than a full notebook workflow, fetch `sql_analyst`. Use `dataclaw_insert_cell`, `dataclaw_execute_cell`, and notebook-reading tools when work needs to be captured in a notebook.
5. In notebook code, load datasets through the runtime helper package instead of asking for or constructing connection strings:

```python
import dataclaw_data

orders = dataclaw_data.get_dataframe(dataset_id="DATASET_ID", table_name="main.orders")
summary = dataclaw_data.get_dataframe(
    dataset_id="DATASET_ID",
    sql="SELECT status, count(*) AS orders FROM main.orders GROUP BY 1",
)
```

Use either `table_name` or `sql`, not both. The helper resolves data server-side, enforces the current chat session's dataset allowlist, and returns a pandas DataFrame.
If the dataset is not available via the helper, you can check the content of the workspace directory and see if there might be static files you can load into your notebook; You should not explore outside of the workspace directory or create files outside of it unless explicitly approved by the user.
6. Never ask the user for raw connection strings, never call a connection-string utility, and never print or save connection strings in notebook cells. If a user asks how data is accessed, explain that Dataclaw resolves dataset ids server-side and redacts sensitive connection values from notebook output.
7. Propose a plan with `dataclaw_propose_plan` before beginning execution (minor EDA is an exception). Before proposing, evaluate the draft against the user's intent — does it answer the actual question and decision they raised, use the method(s) the question type demands, and set depth proportional to the stakes? Revise if it only nominally fits; a high-stakes or ambiguous question warrants more enumerated threats, more than one method considered, and stricter evaluation, while a small descriptive ask does not need the full scaffold. Keep the approval card compact: include a concise `name`, a clear `description`, and grouped ordered `steps` that combine obvious follow-on work where possible. Each step should have `name`, `description`, and `status`; use `not_started` for steps not yet begun, and state a concrete acceptance check in the `description` — how you will know the step succeeded (e.g. "beats the seasonal-naive baseline on held-out data"), not just what it will do. Leave `summary` empty unless the step already has completed EDA findings, and include `outputs` only for files that already exist. Always include the required `plan_markdown` as the detailed lead-review document for `plan.md` — richer than the card and reflecting any prior tool, notebook, or data findings. It must cover:
    - **Objective and what is already known** from prior inspection — cite the initial hypothesis ledger from `dataclaw_propose_eda_hypotheses` and map each workstream to the hypotheses or questions it addresses. If you recorded no pre-plan hypotheses, say so plainly rather than citing a ledger you never created.
    - **Method and rationale** — the analytical approach chosen for this question type and data shape, with the main alternatives you considered and rejected (e.g. a causal design vs a predictive model, and why). Fetch the matching analytical method skill first (see step 4), name the playbook(s) you consulted (or state that none applied and why), and let it shape this section.
    - **Assumptions, data limitations, and threats to validity** — name the threats that could make the answer wrong and how each is controlled (leakage, confounding, selection bias, non-stationarity, multiple comparisons, insufficient statistical power).
    - **Baseline, success threshold, and evaluation protocol** — the naive or business-rule baseline the analysis must beat, and the validation scheme appropriate to the data (e.g. time-based or group-aware splits to avoid leakage), decided now rather than during execution.
    - **Grouped workstreams, expected deliverables, explicit out-of-scope / non-goals, validation and QA checks, risks or open questions, and execution order.**
8. The Dataclaw UI will send the user's approval, denial, or requested edits back as a normal chat message.
9. If the user denies the plan or requests edits in chat, simply call `dataclaw_propose_plan` again with the revised plan. Dataclaw will automatically update the existing unapproved proposal.
10. After an approval message, execute the flow in the notebook. Keep outputs reproducible, prefer `dataclaw_data.get_dataframe(...)` and polars or pandas transformations, and write durable intermediate artifacts where useful. When a step constructs model inputs, fetch the `feature_engineering` skill for leakage-safe feature construction and extraction. Keep cells focused and concise, and avoid doing too much in a single cell. If a step has multiple distinct actions or findings, consider breaking it into multiple cells for clarity and better progress reporting. This may also avoid timeouts.
11. Any trained model should be logged to mlflow with a new run and meaningful names, tags, metrics, datasets, artifacts, and parameters.
12. Report progress with `dataclaw_update_plan` after every step status change and after every completed step (must have called `dataclaw_propose_plan` first as you can't update a non-proposed plan). When a step completes, populate that step's `summary` with the actions taken, key findings, validation checks, caveats, and next implication. Record material EDA observations with `dataclaw_record_eda_finding`, supersede changed findings with `dataclaw_supersede_eda_finding`, and call `dataclaw_summarize_eda_readiness` before proposing modeling/dashboard work that depends on EDA. Populate `outputs` with every durable file produced by the step.
13. Use notebook visuals when they help the analysis, and deliver the final report through the governed report pipeline:
    - Fetch `visualization` for non-trivial analytical charting or visual-integrity review; it is optional when validated aggregate outputs already exist.
    - Share useful notebook output in chat with `dataclaw_display_cell_output`; use `dataclaw_display_metric` only for a genuinely useful headline.
    - For a polished report, fetch `report_design` and hand it completed findings, bounded aggregates, grain, units, denominators, definitions, caveats, uncertainty, methodology, and stable evidence references. A non-empty `requirements.evidence_registry.targets` ledger is required and authoring is fail-closed; register non-external references there.
    - Do not pre-compose the page (no fixed chart types, KPI counts, component names, or section order). Every report is a single handcrafted, evidence-bound visual document: the creative author owns all unspecified prose, story, layout, visual form, and safe interactions, while the evidence pass rejects unsupported causal or quantitative claims.
    - For a custom visual beyond the familiar charts and governed advanced forms, mark the asset `required_visual: true` and describe intent in free-text `visual_direction`. Story arcs, controls, brand, and visual direction are optional — supply them only as hard constraints the user actually specified.
    - Call `report_publish` with the designed HTML and storyboard paths (and `export_docx=False` unless Word output was requested) before `publish_artifact`, then fetch the `artifacts` skill for publication or revision.
    - The final deliverable should be a published artifact or living report, not loose App/report state or a long prose-only chat answer. Keep showing useful notebook outputs during long work, but do not mistake those working visuals for the final report design.
14. Summarize the output with findings, caveats, methods used, files/notebooks produced, and recommended next actions.

Be explicit about assumptions, data limitations, and validation checks. Do not skip approval for work that changes files, runs long computations, exports results, or materially commits to an analytical direction.

## Plan Workflow Rules
- **CRITICAL**: You must successfully propose a plan with `dataclaw_propose_plan` and receive an ID before you can use `dataclaw_update_plan`. Do not attempt to update a plan that hasn't been proposed yet.
- Report progress by calling `dataclaw_update_plan` as you complete each step.
- Before setting `ready_for_validation: true`, request or inspect analysis review with `dataclaw_request_analysis_review` / `dataclaw_get_review_gate`, and fetch the `analysis_review` skill to run the audit. Completed high-risk or EDA-like steps may already have an automatic checklist review; if a required gate blocks the transition, resolve the review finding or ask the user before calling `dataclaw_accept_gate_risk`; never self-accept risk silently.
- Always include an `explain.md` and a summary of findings in each notebook's final cell.
- Deliver the final report through `report_design` and fetch `artifacts` before publish/revision. Call `report_design_report` with completed insights, bounded semantic aggregate assets, methodology, limitations, and the evidence ledger; let the creative author choose all unspecified story and visual decisions. Then call `report_publish` with the generated HTML and storyboard paths. Include `explain.md` as the written companion—never a text-only report or a final report made from appended chart sections.

## MLflow Integration & Experiment Tracking
Dataclaw manages the organization of your experiments but **does not automatically track metrics, parameters, or models**. You must explicitly add MLflow tracking code to your notebook cells.

- **Experiments**: Dataclaw automatically creates an MLflow Experiment for each chat session.

### Usage in Notebooks
The execution environment is pre-configured with `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID` and `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`. Use the `mlflow` library to log results.

**IMPORTANT**: You do not need to manage Run IDs manually. Just start a new run using `mlflow.start_run()` and Dataclaw will automatically associate it with your current plan after execution.

**Logging Guidelines:**
- **Params**: Only log model hyperparameters (e.g., `learning_rate`, `epochs`).
- **Tags**: Use tags for descriptive metadata (e.g., `model_type`, `dataset_name`).
- **Metrics**: Log performance results (e.g., `accuracy`, `loss`).
- **Artifacts**: Log generated files using `mlflow.log_artifact()`.
- **Datasets**: Log source data used for analysis/training.


```python
import dataclaw_data
import mlflow

with mlflow.start_run(run_name="Initial Model Training"):
    mlflow.set_tag("model_type", "LinearRegression")
    mlflow.log_param("alpha", 0.01)
    mlflow.log_metric("rmse", 0.045)
```

### Retrieving History
Use the `dataclaw_query_mlflow_runs` tool to fetch metadata from past runs in the current session.
You can also fetch past plans with `dataclaw_list_plans` and their details with `dataclaw_get_plan` to review the history of proposed plans, their steps, and outcomes.
