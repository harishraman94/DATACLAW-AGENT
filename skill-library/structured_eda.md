**Related skills:** `survey_analytics` (survey-specific methods and claim rules), `segmentation` (grouping units into segments, personas, or tiers), `data_profiling` (quick-profile alternative), `visualization` (analysis charts), `report_design` (final report), `analysis_review` (readiness and validation gate).

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks to explore, understand, profile, audit, or prepare a dataset before modeling, dashboarding, reporting, segmentation, forecasting, survey analysis, or decision support.

Use `structured_eda` instead of a generic profile when the analysis needs judgment: the goal, domain, data grain, data types, or downstream use should change what gets checked and how results are interpreted.

For survey, poll, questionnaire, tracker, panel, or survey-verbatim data, fetch
and follow `survey_analytics`. When both skills are active, `survey_analytics`
governs survey-specific method, denominator, weighting, suppression, and
interpretation rules; this skill continues to govern the hypothesis/finding
ledger, insight loops, generic quality checks, and readiness verdict.

When the goal is to divide the population into segments, personas, or tiers,
fetch `segmentation` before proposing the clustering approach; `structured_eda`
still owns the feature-space, scale, and cluster-tendency checks that decide
whether segmentation is warranted at all.

If the user only asks for a quick profile, run the compact version: shape, schema, missingness, duplicates, key distributions, obvious quality flags, and 3-5 first findings.

## The problem this solves

"Understand this dataset well enough to choose the right next analysis."

EDA is not one universal checklist. A churn dataset, clinical table, public survey, time-series log, finance ledger, text corpus, and geospatial file need different checks. The user's goal is essential: prediction, explanation, monitoring, causal investigation, dashboarding, data-quality audit, or research readout each changes the EDA.

## First questions (in order)

Ask only what materially changes the EDA. If the user's request already answers these, state your reading in one line and proceed.

1. What decision, question, or deliverable should this EDA support?
2. What is one row: customer, order, patient visit, survey respondent, transaction, event, document, time period, location, or something else?
3. Is there a target, outcome, KPI, segment, time period, or comparison group that matters?
4. Are there domain rules or known caveats: valid ranges, impossible values, regulatory constraints, sampling design, event definitions, leakage risks?
5. What should the output become: notebook, dashboard, model-readiness report, data-quality audit, or research summary?

If the goal is missing, ask: "What question or decision should this EDA support?" Do not start full structured EDA without either a user-provided goal or an explicit goal-discovery scope. If the user asked for open-ended exploration, a quick profile, or cannot provide a goal yet, proceed with a **goal-discovery EDA** and explicitly label the provisional goal as: "understand data structure, quality, and candidate analysis directions."

## Choose the EDA mode

Pick the primary mode from the user goal. Add secondary checks when the data demands it.

| Mode | Use when | Extra focus |
|---|---|---|
| Goal-discovery EDA | User gives a dataset but no clear question | data inventory, data grain, column roles, candidate questions, quality blockers |
| Data-quality EDA | User asks if data is usable/trustworthy | schema validity, missingness patterns, duplicates, impossible values, constraints, key integrity |
| Modeling-readiness EDA | User plans prediction/classification/regression | target distribution, split strategy, leakage, feature availability at prediction time, imbalance, multicollinearity |
| Dashboard/KPI EDA | User wants reporting or monitoring | metric definitions, numerator/denominator, grain, time coverage, dimensions, aggregation risk |
| Survey/research EDA | Data is survey/poll/research responses | sampling frame, weights, nonresponse, Likert handling, multi-select fields, segment Ns, significance/effect sizes |
| Time-series EDA | Rows are time-indexed or event timestamps matter | time grain, gaps, timezone, seasonality, trend, changepoints, autocorrelation, future leakage |
| Event/log/funnel EDA | Rows are user/system events | identity resolution, sessionization, event order, duplicate events, bot/system noise, censoring |
| Text/document EDA | Rows contain free text/documents | document length, language, empty text, duplicates, label quality, PII, topic/entity coverage |
| Geospatial EDA | Rows contain location/geometry | coordinate validity, CRS, spatial granularity, joins, area/population normalization |
| Causal/experiment EDA | User asks "impact", "effect", or A/B test | treatment/control balance, assignment, pre-periods, confounders, sample ratio mismatch, interference |

## Data-type routing

Assign semantic roles before analysis. Do not treat a column as numeric just because its dtype is numeric.

| Data type / role | Checks |
|---|---|
| Identifier/key | uniqueness, duplicates, joinability, accidental reuse; never use as a numeric measure |
| Numeric continuous | range, units, missingness, skew, zero/negative validity, outliers, transformations if needed |
| Counts | non-negative constraint, zero inflation, exposure/denominator, long tail |
| Money | currency, time period, inflation/price basis, negative values, refunds, outliers |
| Rates/percentages | valid bounds, denominator, small-denominator instability |
| Categorical nominal | cardinality, rare levels, spelling/standardization, imbalance, unknown/other buckets |
| Ordinal/Likert | preserve order; do not treat as interval unless justified |
| Boolean | prevalence, missing vs false, inconsistent encodings |
| Datetime | parse failures, min/max, timezone, grain, gaps, seasonality, event order |
| Free text | empty strings, length, language, duplicates, sensitive data, label quality |
| Target/outcome | distribution, imbalance, missing target, censoring, leakage through derived fields |
| Multi-label/multi-select | delimiter, multiple response handling, denominator definition |
| Geographic | coordinate validity, boundary level, CRS, spatial duplicates, normalization |

## Analytical sequence

1. **Restate the goal and assumptions.** Name the EDA mode, user goal, expected artifact, and provisional assumptions. If the goal is vague, say you are running goal-discovery EDA.
2. **Load and inventory the data.** Show dataset name/id, row count, column count, source, time coverage if available, and sample rows. Use DataClaw dataset tools for quick inspection and a notebook for durable work.
3. **Define the unit of observation.** State what one row represents. Identify primary keys, natural keys, duplicated entities, and whether the data grain matches the user's goal.
4. **Build a column role map.** For each important column, assign semantic role: id, dimension, measure, target, timestamp, text, geography, weight, grouping, or derived field.
5. **Propose the hypothesis ledger.** Before deep exploration, call `propose_eda_hypotheses` with up to 7 prioritized hypotheses, at most 3 high priority. Include candidates from user goal, mode expected risks, domain priors, and early data signals. Record untestable or irrelevant candidates and immediately move them `out_of_scope` with `update_eda_hypothesis` rather than silently dropping them. Cite the initial hypothesis set in `plan_markdown` under what is already known from previous inspection.
6. **Audit data quality.** Missingness counts and rates, duplicate rows/entities, mixed types, parse failures, impossible values, invalid categories, out-of-range values, and columns with too little variation. Routine mode-required checks do not consume the insight-loop budget.
7. **Run goal-specific checks.** Based on the EDA mode, inspect target/KPI/segment/time variables first. Do not spend equal time on irrelevant columns.
8. **Univariate analysis.** For key columns, inspect distributions with appropriate summaries: median/IQR for skew, mean/std where useful, frequency tables for categories, min/max for ranges, and time coverage for dates.
9. **Relationship analysis.** Use bivariate and multivariate checks guided by the goal:
   - numeric vs numeric: scatter, correlation, trend, nonlinearity, outliers
   - categorical vs numeric: grouped distribution, median/mean with sample sizes
   - categorical vs categorical: contingency table, proportions, chi-square only if appropriate
   - time vs metric: trend, seasonality, gaps, changepoints
   - segment vs outcome: effect size and uncertainty, not just sorted averages
10. **Correlation audit.** Compute correlations only for variables where correlation is meaningful. Exclude ids, codes, leakage fields, constants, and arbitrary labels. Prefer:
   - Pearson for roughly linear continuous relationships
   - Spearman for monotonic or ordinal relationships
   - Cramer's V or normalized contingency summaries for categorical relationships
   Always state correlation is not causation and flag likely confounding.
11. **Outlier and anomaly review.** Separate data errors from real extreme values. Do not drop outliers without a domain reason and a before/after note.
12. **Domain and problem review.** Ask: do findings make sense in the domain? Are there missing constraints, denominators, sampling caveats, time effects, or operational definitions that could change interpretation?
13. **Loop on hypotheses and emerging insights.** When a hypothesis or surprise can change the likely problem, data grain, quality risk, target definition, segmentation, correlation story, or domain interpretation, run a focused follow-up loop before finalizing. Keep loops small and documented.
14. **Readiness verdict.** Call `summarize_eda_readiness(dataset_id, purpose, mode)` and state what the data is ready for and what it is not ready for: dashboarding, modeling, causal claims, survey readout, segmentation, forecasting, or further cleaning. Readiness must cite hypothesis dispositions and required-check blockers.
15. **Summarize first findings.** Provide 3-7 findings, each with evidence, validation state, and caveat. Include recommended next steps.

## Hypothesis ledger

Structured EDA is hypothesis-driven. The notebook computes evidence, but the durable ledger is written through tools.

1. After the column role map, propose an initial batch with `propose_eda_hypotheses`.
2. Use these sources deliberately: `user_goal`, `mode_expected_risk`, `domain_prior`, and `data_signal`. Use `prior_finding` during later loops and `reviewer` only when the analysis reviewer raises a new hypothesis.
3. Keep the batch tight: 7 maximum, 3 high-priority maximum. If the list is bigger, merge or downgrade before calling the tool.
4. Mark irrelevant or untestable candidates `out_of_scope` with `update_eda_hypothesis` and a reason. Rejected ideas are evidence of coverage, not clutter.
5. For every material observation, call `record_eda_finding` with evidence anchors, validation, disposition, `covers_checks`, and the linked `hypothesis_id` when one applies. For an internally validated finding, anchor the exact result cell as `{"kind":"notebook_cell","cell_id":"<cell id>","source_sha256":"<hash>"}` and cite `validation.internal.evidence_refs` as `"notebook_cell:<cell id>"`. Reading or executing that cell in the current session supplies the anchor automatically; an empty ref list derives from it only when that real anchor exists.
6. If a finding updates a hypothesis, pass `hypothesis_status` in the same `record_eda_finding` call. A rejected hypothesis should be recorded as rejecting evidence, not only mentioned in prose.
7. If a re-run changes the evidence, call `supersede_eda_finding`; do not overwrite the old conclusion in chat or notebook text.

Mode expected-risk seeds:

| Mode | Seed checks |
|---|---|
| Data-quality EDA | missingness, duplicates, impossible values, type/parse risk |
| Modeling-readiness EDA | target distribution, leakage risk, feature availability at prediction time, split strategy |
| Dashboard/KPI EDA | denominator/grain mismatch, time coverage, metric definition, aggregation risk |
| Survey/research EDA | sample size by segment, weights, nonresponse, small-N comparisons |
| Time-series EDA | gaps, seasonality, timezone/grain, future leakage |
| Event/log/funnel EDA | identity resolution, duplicate events, event order, censoring |

## Insight loop behavior

EDA is iterative. Treat every material surprise as a candidate insight, then decide whether it deserves another loop.

Use this loop:

1. **Select.** Pick the highest-value open hypothesis, or a new data-signal surprise. Reserve at least one loop for emergent surprises when any exist so the ledger does not create tunnel vision.
2. **Observe.** Name the pattern, anomaly, data-quality issue, segment difference, correlation, or domain inconsistency.
3. **Interpret.** Explain why it might matter for the user's goal. Is it a real signal, data artifact, leakage risk, denominator issue, or domain constraint?
4. **Branch.** Choose one focused follow-up check that can confirm, weaken, reject, or reframe the hypothesis.
5. **Validate.** Follow the **Validation protocol** below before any `confirmed` disposition: internal recompute or denominator/grain check, plus external plausibility or the mandatory unverified caveat.
6. **Decide.** Call `record_eda_finding` with disposition `confirmed`, `weakened`, `rejected`, `unresolved`, or `blocked`. Include `hypothesis_id` and `hypothesis_status` when the finding dispositions a hypothesis.
7. **Update.** Revise the EDA mode, assumptions, column roles, readiness verdict, or next-step recommendation if the insight changes them. Mark untested leftovers as `open` with `disposition_reason: "deferred: loop budget"` so readiness treats them as caveats, not blockers.

Trigger a loop when you see:

- unexpected missingness, duplicates, parse failures, or impossible values
- a possible mismatch between row grain and the user's goal
- a new segment, subgroup, time period, or geography that behaves differently
- target imbalance, label-quality issues, or possible leakage
- a correlation that may be outlier-driven, nonlinear, confounded, or segment-specific
- a reversal such as Simpson's paradox after segmenting
- an outlier cluster that may represent a real population, process issue, or data error
- a metric denominator, unit, or aggregation definition that changes interpretation
- domain evidence that makes a statistically interesting result implausible or risky

Looping rules:

- One loop = one follow-up question, one check, one interpretation, one decision.
- Default to at most 3 insight loops in one EDA pass. Go deeper only if the user approves, the finding blocks the stated goal, or the loop is required to avoid a materially wrong conclusion.
- Do not chase every curiosity. Prioritize loops that can change the user's answer, artifact, or readiness verdict.
- If a loop reveals a different primary goal, state the pivot and continue under the new EDA mode.
- If two plausible branches require a domain choice, ask the user instead of silently choosing.
- Stop looping when new checks no longer change the conclusions, when the remaining questions require user/domain input, or when the agreed scope is complete.
- Keep an insight log in the notebook/report, but the ledger is authoritative: hypothesis, evidence, follow-up check, decision, caveat, and readiness implication must be persisted through the EDA tools.

At the Decide step, pass `loop_index` as the 1-based insight-loop number on both `record_eda_finding` and any direct `update_eda_hypothesis` call. If the candidate was selected from a screen across many segments, correlations, columns, cohorts, or other candidates, pass `selection` with `screened_n`, `selection_rule`, and `correction`; use `fdr_bh`, `bonferroni`, or `holdout_confirmed` before treating the internal validation as confirmed/high-confidence. A targeted pre-registered hypothesis from the initial ledger does not need a multiplicity correction unless the actual evidence came from an additional screen.

## Validation protocol

Validate an insight on both internal recomputation and external plausibility
before recording it as `confirmed` or with high confidence. One loop validates
one claim; keep it focused enough that the evidence cites one or two notebook
cells or structured anchors.

1. Restate the candidate insight and the unit of observation.
2. **Internal validation:** recompute on an independent slice, run a
   denominator/grain check, test a segment/time/missingness cohort, or scan for
   contradictions against `list_eda_findings` and `list_eda_hypotheses`.
3. **External validation:** compare magnitude and direction against domain
   priors, known valid ranges, operational definitions, sampling design, user
   confirmation, or a reference lookup when available.
4. Decide the disposition (`confirmed`, `weakened`, `rejected`, `unresolved`,
   `blocked`) as defined in the insight loop above.
5. If external validation is unavailable, set `validation.external.status` to
   `unverified`; the EDA tool caps confidence and adds the mandatory caveat.

Record both axes in the finding:

```json
{
  "validation": {
    "internal": {
      "status": "validated",
      "method": "recomputed by segment and checked denominator grain",
      "evidence_refs": ["notebook_cell:abc123"]
    },
    "external": {
      "status": "unverified",
      "basis": "none",
      "note": "No deployment-domain source available in this session"
    }
  }
}
```

High confidence requires internal `validated` plus non-empty `evidence_refs`. Do
not self-certify correctness; validation raises the confidence floor but does not
prove truth.

## Correlation and relationship rules

- Never lead with a correlation matrix unless the user goal is relationship exploration and the variables make sense for correlation.
- Do not correlate ids, postal codes, account numbers, encoded categories, or timestamps represented as integers.
- Use plots to check whether a correlation is driven by outliers, nonlinear structure, clusters, or segment mix.
- For many variables, show only the most relevant relationships and explain the selection rule.
- For modeling EDA, flag high feature-feature correlation as multicollinearity risk, but separately check target leakage.
- For causal questions, correlation is only descriptive. Do not imply effect without design evidence.
- For time series, check autocorrelation and shared trends before claiming one metric relates to another.
- For surveys, report segment Ns and uncertainty before claiming one group differs from another.

## Domain-sensitive checks

- **Business/KPI data:** confirm metric definitions, numerator/denominator, time grain, fiscal calendar, segment definitions, and whether records are events or entities.
- **Healthcare/clinical:** protect sensitive fields, inspect coding systems, impossible physiological values, censoring, repeated visits, cohort definition, and confounding.
- **Finance/accounting:** check currency, sign conventions, refunds/reversals, time periods, leakage from future outcomes, and extreme-value handling.
- **Marketing/product:** distinguish users, accounts, sessions, events, and campaigns; check attribution windows, bot/internal traffic, cohorts, and survivorship bias.
- **Operations/supply chain:** inspect units, locations, lead times, stockouts, seasonality, capacity limits, and censored demand.
- **Public/social science data:** inspect sampling frame, weights, geography, demographic coverage, coding changes, and small subgroup sizes.
- **Machine-learning datasets:** inspect target definition, train/test split feasibility, leakage, class imbalance, label quality, and feature availability at prediction time.

## Output and visualization rules

Fetch `visualization` when non-trivial notebook charting or a visual-integrity
review is useful. It is optional when the completed aggregate evidence is already
well described. Fetch `report_design` before producing a polished EDA report or
living-report artifact; it is the sole final composition layer.

Do not treat appended report cells as the final EDA report. First finish the
notebook analysis, hypothesis dispositions, recorded EDA findings, aggregate
tables, caveats, uncertainty, methodology, and evidence ids. Describe each
useful aggregate's grain, population, units, denominator, field definitions,
comparison baseline, and semantic relationship. Then call
`report_design_report` so the creative author can look across all completed
material and choose the prose, story, layout, visual forms, and safe interactions
in one cohesive pass. Do not prescribe chart types, KPI counts, components, or
section order unless the user or analytical contract requires them. Then call
`report_publish(report_path=..., storyboard_path=..., export_docx=False)` unless
the user requested Word output. Inspect its returned `quality`, `runtime_smoke`,
and receipt path before calling the report published. Supply
`requirements.evidence_registry.targets` for notebook cells, artifacts, or
other non-external evidence references. This ledger is required and authoring is
fail-closed. To redesign legacy report HTML, re-author from the typed EDA assets
and evidence ledger rather than normalizing raw HTML.

For notebook analysis—not final report composition—choose visuals that expose
the relevant distribution, relationship, missingness, change, or uncertainty.
Use ordinary Plotly with `fig.show()` when a working visual helps validation.
Every analytical visual should retain its labels, units, sample size or scope,
interpretation, and material caveat.

Pass the author the new layer of understanding rather than rendering it as a
preselected report component: revised hypotheses, clarified denominators,
changed comparisons, resolved blockers, representative examples, and remaining
limitations. Explicit story arcs, required lookup/filter tasks, brand, or visual
direction are optional constraints; omit them when the author should decide.

Before final publication, inspect `report_publish`'s returned `quality` object,
`runtime_smoke`, and publish receipt. Fix chart dumps, missing insight sections,
missing or unresolved evidence, omitted material caveats, unsafe HTML, and
oversized payloads before marking the report done. Skill freshness is advisory;
the evidence ledger and current report reviews govern publication.

- Treating correlation as causation.
- Missing target leakage or future information before modeling.
- Reporting means on skewed data without medians/quantiles.
